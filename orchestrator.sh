Each file should contain one function with 10-50 lines of code and no external dependencies beyond standard Ruby."
    
    "In scripts-orchestrated/, create 25 Ruby files (script_026.rb to script_050.rb) with string manipulation functions like URL encoding/decoding, HTML escaping, JSON parsing/generation, CSV parsing, regex operations, string validation, text formatting, case conversions, string searching, palindrome checking, anagram detection, word counting, text encryption/decryption, string compression, text parsing, pattern matching, string sanitization, template processing, text analysis, and string utilities. Each file should contain one function with 10-50 lines of code and no external dependencies beyond standard Ruby."
    
    "In scripts-orchestrated/, create 25 Ruby files (script_051.rb to script_075.rb) with utility functions like file operations, directory management, date/time utilities, configuration parsing, logging helpers, cache implementations, validation functions, conversion utilities, formatting helpers, error handling utilities, data transformation, collection utilities, enumeration helpers, iterator functions, functional programming utilities, lambda expressions, closure examples, method chaining, object utilities, and helper methods. Each file should contain one function with 10-50 lines of code and no external dependencies beyond standard Ruby."
    
    "In scripts-orchestrated/, create 25 Ruby files (script_076.rb to script_100.rb) with mathematical functions like statistical calculations, probability functions, geometric calculations, trigonometric operations, algebraic solutions, number theory functions, prime number operations, factorial calculations, Fibonacci sequences, matrix operations, vector calculations, coordinate geometry, random number generation, mathematical modeling, equation solving, numerical methods, optimization algorithms, graph theory functions, combinatorics, and mathematical utilities. Each file should contain one function with 10-50 lines of code and no external dependencies beyond standard Ruby."
