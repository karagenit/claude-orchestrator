Perfect! I've successfully created all 10 Ruby files in the scripts-orchestrated/ directory with the requested data structures and algorithms functions:

1. **script_001.rb** - Binary search (iterative and recursive)
2. **script_002.rb** - Bubble sort (basic and optimized)
3. **script_003.rb** - Factorial (iterative, recursive, memoized, and array versions)
4. **script_004.rb** - Fibonacci (iterative, recursive, memoized, sequence, and matrix versions)
5. **script_005.rb** - Palindrome check (basic, two-pointers, recursive, and longest substring)
6. **script_006.rb** - Reverse string (built-in, iterative, recursive, two-pointers, and word variations)
7. **script_007.rb** - Prime check (basic, optimized, sieve, factors, and next prime)
8. **script_008.rb** - GCD (iterative, recursive, extended, LCM, and multiple numbers)
9. **script_009.rb** - Merge arrays (simple, sorted, unique, multiple, and custom callbacks)
10. **script_010.rb** - Find max (basic, with index, recursive, divide & conquer, and subarray problems)

Each file contains comprehensive implementations with 10-50+ lines of Ruby code, multiple algorithm variations, and example usage with no external dependencies (except for one optional library fallback in script_010.rb).
